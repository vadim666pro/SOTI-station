# Lidgren.Network (Space Wizards Edition) ![Build & Test](https://github.com/space-wizards/lidgren-network-gen3/workflows/Build%20&%20Test/badge.svg) [![NuGet link](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/SpaceWizards.Lidgren.Network)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/SpaceWizards.Lidgren.Network)
Lidgren.Network is a networking library for .NET, which uses a single UDP socket to deliver a simple API for connecting a client to a server, reading and sending messages. It supports **.NET Standard 2.1+**.

**Space Wizards Edition** is a maintained fork of Lidgren.Network with improvements such as bugfixes, performance improvements (`Span<T>`!), new features, etc... See the [Release Notes](RELEASE-NOTES.md) for differences.

We're using `SpaceWizards.Lidgren.Network` as a networking layer for [Space Station 14](https://spacestation14.io) and [Robust](https://github.com/space-wizards/RobustToolbox).
